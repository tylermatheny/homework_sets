    "1. Write a script that prompts the user to input numbers separated by commas. Your script will then take these inputted numbers and store them as a list of tuples, two at a time. Finally, your script will print that list of tuples to the user. If the user inputs an odd number of numbers, then only make a list of the largest number of pairs of two that are possible.\n",
