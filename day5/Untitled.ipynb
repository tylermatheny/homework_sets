Write a function that takes a `name`, and then returns a `True` or `False` as to whether or not they are an Elsa fan. You can use the knowledge that if they aren't Cary, Josh, or Sean, they aren't an Elsa fan. Also, remember that checking membership using a `set` is incredibly fast! Try to use a `set` if you can.\n",
