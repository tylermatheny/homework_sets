    "\n",
    "    2. Instances of the `Company` class will have the following methods: \n",
    "\n",
    "        * `serve_customer` - this method will take in a `float` that is equal to the cost of serving some customer, and then adjust the `total_revenue` by that cost. \n",
    "        * `gain_employees` - this method will take in a `list` that contains new employees that the company has just brought on, and will update the `num_employees` attribute to take account of that. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let's build a `TV` class, used to represent a television. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. In this class, we'll have the following attributes: \n",
    "\n",
    "        * `brand` - `str` holding the brand of the television ('Sony', 'LG', etc.)\n",
    "        * `on_status` - `bool` holding whether or not the television is on. This should default to False (e.g. off). \n",
    "        * `current_channel` - `int` holding the current channel number. If the television is off, then the `current_channel` should be 0. Given that `on_status` defaults to off, what does that mean the `current_channel` should default to?\n",
    "        * `life_perc` - `float` holding the percentage of life left in the TV. This should start out at 100% (i.e. default to 100). \n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Instances of the `TV` class will have the following methods: \n",
    "\n",
    "        * `hit_power` - this will turn the television on/off, depending on whether it's already on/off (if its on it'll switch it off, and vice versa). We'll add a couple of stipulations with this one: \n",
    "            * Each time the television is turned off, it loses a little bit of life - decrease the `life_perc` by 0.01 each time the television is turned off. \n",
    "            * Each time the television is turned off the channel should be set to 0. \n",
    "        * `change_channel` - this will take in an `int` to change the channel to a new one. We'll add a stipulation to this as well: \n",
    "        * If the television is not on, but the `change_channel` method is called, print 'Television is not on!'. Otherwise, change the channel to the inputted channel. "
